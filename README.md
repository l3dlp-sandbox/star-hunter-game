<p>
Use arrow- or WADX to move and space to jump. Use S to shoot orbs that kills enemies. Use ESC to pause. The goal is to gather all stars on each level.
When using a touch-screen, an on-screen DPad joystick + an action buttons are used for movements. A secondary action button is used for shooting orbs.
